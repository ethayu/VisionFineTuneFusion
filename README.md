# VisionFineTuneFusion
Harmonize vision foundation models by finetuning DINO features with CLIPâ€™s semantic insights. This project fuses structural precision and semantic richness, enhancing tasks like image retrieval, segmentation, and zero-shot learning. A step toward bridging self-supervised and multimodal understanding in vision AI.

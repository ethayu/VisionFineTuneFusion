# VisionFineTuneFusion: Efficient Vision-Language Alignment for Retrieval and Depth Estimation

This project ([paper here](paper.pdf)) focuses on integrating DINO's structural embeddings with CLIP's semantic insights to enhance various vision tasks, demonstrating improved performance in **instance retrieval** and **depth estimation** with a more compact embedding dimension (512 vs. 768). Our approach introduces a novel framework that fine-tunes DINO embeddings using lightweight autoencoders while aligning them with CLIP embeddings to inject semantic information. The method is efficient, leveraging frozen pre-trained models (DINO and CLIP) and adding task-specific learning through reconstruction and alignment losses.

## Approach

- **Two Autoencoders**: We train two autoencoders, one for DINO's class token (CLS) embedding and another for its patch embeddings. These autoencoders compress the embeddings while preserving reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment.
- **Alignment with CLIP**: During training, we align DINO's embeddings with CLIP's multimodal embeddings using cosine similarity loss. This alignment is applied to both the CLS and patch embeddings.
- **Frozen Pretrained Models**: Both DINO and CLIP weights are frozen, ensuring that the training focuses on learning lightweight, task-specific embeddings.

## Tasks

1. **Instance Retrieval**:
   - Retrieve images similar to a query image based on their visual features.
   - Uses DINO’s CLS and patch embeddings as input, fine-tuned with CLIP alignment.
   - Efficient indexing and retrieval are implemented using FAISS.

2. **Depth Estimation**:
   - Predict pixel-wise depth maps from RGB images.
   - Uses DINO’s features as input to two separate autoencoders (CLS and patch-based).
   - Outputs compressed, semantically-enriched embeddings used for regression tasks.

## Training Pipeline

1. **Embedding Extraction**:
   - Pass the image through DINO to obtain its CLS and patch embeddings.
   - Pass the image and corresponding text through CLIP to extract two global embeddings (image and text).
   - Patch the image, upsample each patch, and pass through CLIP to obtain patch-wise embeddings.

2. **Autoencoder Training**:
   - Train the CLS autoencoder with reconstruction loss and a CLIP alignment loss using CLIP’s global embeddings.
   - Train the patch autoencoder with reconstruction loss and alignment loss for each patch embedding with CLIP.

3. **Loss Function**:
   - The total loss combines reconstruction and alignment objectives:
     ```
     L_total = L_reconstruction^CLS + L_alignment^CLS + L_reconstruction^patch + L_alignment^patch
     ```

## Results

- **Instance Retrieval**: Achieved higher retrieval accuracy with smaller embedding dimensions (512 vs. 768).
- **Depth Estimation**: Improved depth mapping results while leveraging compressed embeddings, enhancing both global (CLS) and local (patch) predictions.
